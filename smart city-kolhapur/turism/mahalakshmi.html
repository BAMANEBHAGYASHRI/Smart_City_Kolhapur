The temple belongs architecturally to the Chalukya Empire and may have to been first built in circa 700 AD. The idol of Mahalaxmi carved in black stone is a three feet in height. The image of the four armed and crowned Goddess is made by gemstone and weight about forty kilograms. The Shree Yantra is carved on one of the walls in the temple. A stone lion, the conveyance of the Goddess Mahalaxmi, stand behind the idol. The crown contains an image of the Sheshnag, the serpent of Lord Vishnu. In her four hands, the deity of Goddess Mahalaxmi holds of symbolic value. The lower right hand holds a Mhalunga ( a citrus fruit), in the upper right, a large mace (Koumodaki) with its head touching the ground, in the upper left a shield (Khetaka) and the lower left, a bowl (Panpatra). Unlike most Hindu sacred images, which face north or east, the image of this deity looks west (Pashchim). There is a small open window on the western wall, through which the light of the setting sun falls on the face of the image for three days around the 21st of each March and September. There are a number of other shrines in the courtyard to the Navagrahas, Surya, Mahishasuramardini, Vitthal-Rakhmai, Shiva, Vishnu, Tulaja Bhavani and others. Some of these images date back to the 11th century, while some are of recent origin. Also located in the courtyard is the temple tank Manikarnika Kund, on whose bank is a shrine to Visweshwar Mahadev.</p>
