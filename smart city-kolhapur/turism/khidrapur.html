To the main building are attached two richly sculptured mandapas or vestibules. In the vestibule are two concentric squares the outer with twenty and the inner with twelve pillars all are richly carved.

Sanctum sanctorum has images of ‘Kopeshwar’ (God Mahadev) and Dhopeshwar (God Vishnu). At the back along the wall, sculptures of eighteen divine damsels stand on a semicircular pedestal.
