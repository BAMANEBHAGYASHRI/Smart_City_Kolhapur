 Senapati Prataprao Gujar Samadhi : Prataprao Gujar born as Kudtoji Gujar, was the third royal Senapati (Commander-in-chief of the Maratha forces) of Chh. Shivaji Maharaja’s army, which was probably the most successful guerilla force in 17th century India. He was giving the pseudonym of Prataprao – the brave, by Chh. Shivaji in acknowledgement of his bravery in the war against Mirza Jaisingh. He was highly gifted aristocratic general, who enjoyed the truth of his King and the loyalty of his troops. He defeated a large Mughal army at the famous battle of Salher. Salher was a major battle between Mughals and Marathas, and the first large scale pitched battle the two in open field. The victory of the Marathas at Salher is seen as a definitive turning point in their military powers. A few months before Chh. Shivaji Maharajas coronation in 1674, Prataprao Gujar was sent to deal with the invading force led by the Adilshahi general, Bahalol Khan.</p>

 When Chh. Shivaji Maharajas heard of about Prataprao decision, he was incensed and wrote an angry letter to Prataprao refusing him permission to see him such time, Bahalol Khan re-captured. Prataprao realized his mistake and was so upset about what he had done that he now wanted to capture Bahalol Khan at any cost. One day, he learnt of Bahalol Khan camping nearby. Prataprao decided to make a stand against Bahalol Khan at Nesari near Kolhapur. Prataprao Gujar’s with 1200 troops versus Khan with 15000. So, Prataprao reasoned that there was no point in taking 1200 men to suicide with him.
